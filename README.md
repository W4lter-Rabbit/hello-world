# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub containing starting projects

Hello world, an introduction my name is Wouter and i'm 26 i live in the Netherlands. This is my first file on GitHub and i hope many will follow.
I finally got the courage to persue love for creating, improving and solving issues.

Here's my story

I never fitted in the school system in my country. At my elementary school i had a hard time focusing on the classes i was either bored or daydreaming. Even though i actually never payed attention i passed school easily. This carried over to middle school ahd high school. Which i also passed easily even though i could have probally finished it with higher results if i had put in just a tiny bit of effort.

After school my parents gave me two choices either go to school and study or work for money. Since i didn't know what i wanted to study i wasn't ready to commit 4 years and a lot of money for something i wasn't sure i even liked. So i started doing jobs that seemed nice and always for the wrong reasons i needed money everyone needs money right?

Going from job to job never lasting for more than a year. It always started the same i was genuine enthusiastic and eager to learn hoping this finally was a job i enjoyed in the long run. Every passing month my motivating decreased the salary i once was totally okay with now seemed way to little. Early mornings were getting earlier time passed more slowely and long workdays took forever. At this point i would always tell myself every job has it downside stop complaining you need the money. This pushed me for a few more weeks maybe a month. Until it burned me out going to work took me so much energy dragging my body to work faking a smile. It effected my personal life to i didnt feel as much joy from life as i used to. Everyday i longed for distraction anything that would take my mind of my the life that i became to hate more and more. 

Realizing i spend most of my time at a place that made me feel miserable. I decided that i wanted to spend more time doing things i love than things i hate. So 11pm became 2pm and weekends became 48 hour partys i squeezed out every single minute i didnt have to work. This made it even worse i could never pull myself out of bed and i frequently overslept. Motivation dropped even more how could it not i was sleep deprived which led to health issues. Both employes and co-workers started to dislike me, not because of my personality but the lack of motivation and not wanting to take extra shifts or fill in. Already spending more time than i would like i wasn't gonna spend any more than necessary. 

I always wondered why it seemed like no one else felt like i did i told myself "They must have horrible personal lifes not wanting to go home". 
Assuming they were the problem i blamed my co-workers for working to hard and taking on many shifts so expectations would be raised. 
I would always ask myself "Do i see myself doing this everyday for the rest of my working days". And the awnser would always be the same.
Fortunately i never did get fired however i always ended up quiting. I didnt know what i wanted to do with life but i did know that this wasn't it. 

This kept happening a few years until i asked myself what am i doing wrong for this to keep happening. I thought long and hard finally realizing my co-workers weren't the ones with horribles lifes well maybe a few of them. It was me i was working for money rather than passion and joy. All new things are exciting in the beginning but unless you are really passionate about it the excitement wil not last.

Realizing i needed to change things i tryed to combine the things i liked doing the most and translate it into a job. Several came into mind but with a big intrest in electronincs loving to create stuff improve it and fixing issues Software development triumphed them all. Having a 4 month old son and a wife kept me from starting an education i wanted to give them certainty. Starting an education would mean more pressure on my wife taking care of our son and we wouldn't be able to pay the rent. So i decided to do tutorials in my spare time. Wonders happend i loved doing it how could i not i was creating code/projects improving it and fixing if needed to be al on electronic devices. Everything i love doing ofcourse at some point there will be something i will dislike. But hey like i said every job like most things in life will have less likeable things. Like our son his smile lights up the whole room and the joy he brings to our lifes is unlike anything else. But when he wakes us at 4am crying for no apparent reason there's a little less joy at that moment.

After a month learning Python through udemy and youtube videos my boss approached me at work for my yearly contract negotiations. After 30 seconds in he told me they had to cut costs due to the corona virus and since my contract was temporary employment i was an easy way to cut costs. I was shocked i just finished a course within the company which was beneficial for both of us. Even though i didnt like the job my sales targets were always way above average. Even though i preformed well the company made to much losses and they couldnt affort to extent my contract.

So me and my wife talked about the situation and even though its gonna take time, dedication and less income we decided this is the perfect oppurtunity to go all in for something i like rather than something that pays money. So here my journey begins!

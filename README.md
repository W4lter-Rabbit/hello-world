# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub containing starting projects

Hello world, an introduction my name is Wouter and i'm 26 i live in the Netherlands. This is my first file on GitHub and i hope many will follow.
I finally got the courage to persue love for creating, improving and solving issues.

Here's my story

I never fitted in the school system in my country. At my elementary school i had a hard time focusing on the classes i was either bored or daydreaming. Even though i actually never payed attention i passed school easily. This carried over to middle school ahd high school. Which i also passed easily even though i could have probally finished it with higher results if i had put in just a tiny bit of effort.

After school i went from job to job never lasting for more than a year. I didnt know what i wanted to do with life but i did know that this wasn't it. Early morning's long work days and low hourly rate. Every job i had i started enthusiastic and a few months in i would always ask myself "Do i see myself doing this everyday for the rest of my working days". And the awnser would always be the same.

My parents gave me two choices either go to school and study or work for money. Since i didn't know what i wanted to study i wasn't ready to commit 4 years and a lot of money for something i wasn't sure i even liked. So i started doing jobs that seemed nice and always for the wrong reasons i needed money everyone needs money right? Time passed on and with each job i had my motivation decreased and so did the joy in life. Everyday i longed for distraction anything that would take my mind of my the life that i became to hate more and more. 

I decided that i wanted to spend more time doing things i love than things i hate. So 11pm became 2pm and weekends became 48 hour partys i squeezed out every single minute i didnt have to work. This made it even worse i could never pull myself out of bed and i frequently overslept. Motivation dropped even more how could it not i was sleep deprived which led to health issues. Both employes and co-workers started to dislike me, not because of my personality but the lack of motivation and not wanting to take extra shifts or fill in. Already spending more time than i would like i wasn't gonna spend any more than necessary.
